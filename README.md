# Simple_SocialMedia_WebApp
This was a Database Management final project that I worked on with a partner during my Fall 2020 semester. The Code mainly consists of simple HTML, CSS, and PHP. This application also interacts with a remote hosted MySQL database which is used to populate and store all our information.
Below is another copy of the link that it provided in the 'about' section of my repo
This appliation is currently being hosted over my Universities super coputer dedicated to hosting live web applications.
